A bloat-free knowledge-base for students/professionals. I don't like paying for simple software. So, I created this. Anki is a very good & useful tool, unless you take into consideration that the mobile version (which is just meant to be a companion for the actual app), costs way too much. Moreover, who likes GUIs??

### THIS IS A CLI APP!!
I didn't write that heading to scare you away. It's more like a warning.
If you came here looking for alternative, you'll not be disappointed. But, if you're going to spam my inbox asking where is the .EXE & why is GUI not popping up? Well, I'll have to block you & then we'd both be disappointed :-(.

## Usage
- You would need a Linux-like environment to be able to run this app. Sorry. It's just that I don't have enough time from my day-job that I spend the rest of my time debugging 1000 word long error messages from `Wondoows.h`.
- The good part is that you could just install a WSL within your Windows OS & you'll be good to go.

### Building from Source (for them nerds out there)
1. clone the repo
2. run the build script provided.
3. tinker with the code. no, really. I'd appreciate any improvements.
4. Optional, someone please containerize this application. I know, it's a small thing, but I've been procrastinating it for ages now.
5. just run from your terminal - that's what CLI apps do best, duh? The command is: `<APPNAME>`.

### The Other way
If you just want it to work, not bothered about the code or anything. Just download from [here](https://google.com/). You  really fell for it XD.
and then simply run from terminal using: `<APPNAME>`.
